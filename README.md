Project Idea:

To play an arcade like game on your computer

Features:

Game contains a log in and registration page
A top up credits page used to play the physical claw game 
A record of the prizes won : big and small prize with different difficulties
A button to play the game itself
The game is like a claw machine where there is only one button
When the car moves to the correct spot, press the space bar or left most click to aim for the winning surface. 

Design your System:
The system design is a simple green and purple scheme
The app looks like an arcade game.

Necessary Technologies:
Python
Command Socket functions 
Video streaming (Flask/OpenCV)
SQL to create the database for the app

Technical Proof of concept:
See the file 

**To run the file:**

**1. Download the schema ORBITAL Database.sql**

**2. Open Orbit.py and change the username and password below the first function defined to your individual one**

**3. Connect to SQL**

**4. Close all files and run interface.py**

Core features Developed:

The UI uses tkinter as the GUI
The UI has been fully linked to the SQL data base showing how many coins the player has to play the arcade game as well as how many prizes he has won from the game.
